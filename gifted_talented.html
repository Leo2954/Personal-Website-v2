        <h1>My Opinion on Gifted and Talented Education</h1>
        <div class="article-box">
            <h2>Foreword</h2>
            <p>
                What follows are my unfiltered thoughts as an identified Gifted and Talented (GT) student. Before I start, I want to say that these are merely my opinions on my own GT education.
                I know there are others who may disagree. Here, I'm going to write about the pros and cons of my GT education.
            </p>
            <h2>Pros</h2>
            <p>
                In elementary school, the GT students were assigned a GT project. For example, we designed a toy or built a bridge that had to hold a certain amount of weight. 
                I loved these projects, and my friends and I even designed a board game that was chosen to be presented at district GT showcase. Another good thing
                was in elementary school, I could stay in the same class with my friends year after year. That was probably the best thing about GT; I made lasting friendships throughout elementary school.
            </p>
            <h2>Cons</h2>
            <p>
                I believe there are a lot more cons to my GT education compared to the pros. A lasting effect of GT was that I now have a superiority complex despite having nothing to show for it.
                When a small child is told that they can read at a blazing pace, can comprehend complex material, is an exceptional problem-solver, has superb pattern-recognition capabilities, and is brilliant at math, it does something to them.
                They are even given a different title: "Gifted and Talented". It makes them think that they're innately better than everyone else when that isn't true.
