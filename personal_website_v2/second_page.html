        <h1>My Senior Year Thoughts</h1>
        <div class="thoughts-box">
            <p>
                What follows are my unfiltered thoughts as a high school senior. My childhood is really almost over. It's kind of incredible how slow yet how fast the years have gone
                by. I still remember each grade vividly, almost as if they happened last week. It's difficult to describe how I feel,
                mainly because I'm feeling tons of emotions at once. I think I'm happy I'm finally leaving. I like to learn, but the public school
                environment just isn't for me. Unlike others, I don't have anyone I'll miss. I had friends, but nothing seemed permanent.
                There's nothing for me here anymore, and I'm ready to get out. I'm going to miss my family though. I can't say that I'll
                miss high school, in fact, I think I'll say the opposite. I hope I truly find my people in college. A new beginning, if you will.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I don't know, however, is where I'll end up. It could be anywhere from Texas A&M to Cornell. I have the innate desire within me
                to go to the best school possible, but with the way admissions are these days, I simultaneously have and don't have a shot everywhere. 
                I can't do anything about what I've done anymore though; the only thing I can do is write the best essays possible and pray.
                Where I ever I go, I hope it's truly the best school for me academically, socially, and professionally. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To sum things up: Thank God it's almost over, here's to the next chapter of my life.
