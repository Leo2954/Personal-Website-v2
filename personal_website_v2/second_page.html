        <h1>My Senior Year Thoughts</h1>
        <div class="thoughts-box">
            <p>
                What follows are my unfiltered thoughts as a high school senior. My childhood is really almost over. It's kind of incredible how slow yet how fast the years have gone
                by. I still remember each grade vividly, almost as if they happened last week. It's difficult to describe how I feel,
                mainly because I'm feeling tons of emotions at once. I think I'm happy I'm finally leaving. I like to learn, but the public school
                environment just isn't for me. Unlike others, I don't have anyone I'll miss. I had friends, but nothing seemed permanent. 
                I know lots of people who have made tons of friends and had a great time, but I'm not one of them.
                There's nothing for me here anymore, and I'm ready to get out. I'm going to miss my family though. I can't say that I'll
                miss high school, in fact, I think I'll say the opposite. I hope I truly find my people in college. A new beginning, if you will.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I don't know, however, is where I'll end up. It could be anywhere from Texas A&M to Cornell. I have the innate desire within me
                to go to the best school possible, but with the way admissions are these days, I simultaneously have and don't have a shot anywhere. 
                I think the worst part of college admissions is how nuanced they are. Academics are but one part of the holistic review that encompasses attributes
                that may or may not be out of your control. Sometimes I wish that I wasn't the high performing and high scoring student I am. There's a pressure to
                apply to elite universities simply because of my stats, when in reality that's only one small piece of the puzzle.
                I can't do anything about what I've done anymore though; the only thing I can do is write the best essays possible and pray.
                Where I ever I go, I hope it's truly the best school for me academically, socially, and professionally. What I can't say, however,
                is that college is going to be a walk in the park. It will probably be the most challenging and rigorous point in my life. But, I've come
                to realize that I need the challenge. School has come too easy, and it's only fair that I struggle as well. What I know for sure is that I'm going to enjoy
                every part of the experience, good and bad. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To sum things up: Thank God it's almost over, and here's to the next chapter of my life.
            </p>

                On April 29th, 2024, I'll edit this website with the university I'm committing to and my complete admissions results. If I don't know which university by then,
                 I'll list my top choices. Speaking of choices, here is my university list: Texas A&M, UT Austin, UIUC, Georgia Tech, UMD, UW Madison, Purdue,
                  Rice, Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Penn, Stanford, Harvard, and Princeton. Additionally, I'll add another page detailing my experience
                  with the college admissions process. I'll document everything: from the Common App, essays, letters of rec, my activities list, waiting for decisions, and finally dealing with decisions.
